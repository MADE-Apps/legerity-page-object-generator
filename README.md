# Page Object Generator for Legerity

The Page Object Generator for Legerity is a companion tool for generating page object representations of UI files from Windows, Android, iOS, and Web applications. It scans the files for UI elements with unique IDs or names in order to generate page object C# classes using the Legerity framework.

This tool allows you to simplify and speed up the development of your UI tests by getting you most of the way there with your page objects. You can then write your page's actions, and build out your test suite.
